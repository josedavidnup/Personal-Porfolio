            I'm a Python developer. I specialized in Machine Learning and I'm
            currently working with the following stack of technologies: Python,
            Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Docker, and
            AWS. I have a background in Full Stack developement with JavaScript.
            I have spent +2 years of my career working for some Pyme
            corporations, in my last role at Full Stack. I consider myself a
            lifelong learner, with a growth mindset, interested in new
            technologies, and enjoy working in a team. I'm open to new
            challenges that allow me to grow in my career and improve skills in
            the field of Machine Learning / Data Science while supporting and
            contributing to the growth of the team and the company.

            I started web developement in 2017 managing multiple e-commerce
            websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and
            Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
            time I run Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web
            developement and various front-end technologies.
